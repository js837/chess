---CASTLING---
The king and the chosen rook are on the player's first rank.[3]
Neither the king nor the chosen rook have previously moved.
There are no pieces between the king and the chosen rook.
The king is not currently in check.
The king does not pass through a square that is attacked by an enemy piece.[4]
The king does not end up in check. (True of any legal move.)


-- EN PASSANT --
the capturing pawn must be on its fifth rank;
the captured pawn must be on an adjacent file and must have just moved two squares in a single move (i.e. a double-step move);
the capture can only be made on the move immediately after the opposing pawn makes the double-step move; otherwise the right to capture it en passant is lost.

--PROMOTION--
Promotion is a chess rule that a pawn that reaches its eighth rank is immediately changed into the player's choice of a queen, knight, rook, or bishop of the same color.[1] The new piece replaces the pawn on the same square, as part of the same move. 



--CHECK--
A player may not make any move which places or leaves his king in check. The possible ways to get out of check are:

Move the king to a square where it is not threatened.
Capture the threatening piece (possibly with the king).
Block the check by placing a piece between the king and the opponent's threatening piece (Just & Burg 2003:27), (Polgar & Truong 2005:32,103), (Burgess 2009:550).


-- STALE MATE--
The game is automatically a draw if the player to move is not in check but has no legal move. This situation is called a stalemate. An example of such a position is shown in the diagram to the right.
